# To install all the files automatically run ./install.sh

or you can install it manually by moving the files folder contents to your server directory

# files should be located at localhost/files after running "install.sh"

you can check it by running your server and typing in the  browser search bar "localhost/files" 

# To remove all the changes run ./uninstall.sh


Good day :)
