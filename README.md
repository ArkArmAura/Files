# The files will be located at localhost/files .

you can check it by running your server and typing in the search bar localhost/files 

# To install all the files automatically run ./install.sh

or you can install it manually by moving the files folder contents to your server directory

# To remove all the changes run ./uninstall.sh


Good day :)
